# Sponsors

MinneHack is a regional hackathon – a software development competition. Most hackathons take place over a 24 hour period and include any number of teams that are comprised of up to four students. Previous iterations of MinneHack (including our first annual hackathon, originally branded UHack) have attracted 300+ students from 14 colleges and 5 different states – making it the largest hackathon in the Twin Cities! These students consist of motivated software engineers – many of whom are eligible for recruiting.

## Why sponsor?
    
MinneHack is a unique opportunity to connect with the most talented and passionate technical students from around the region.

- Recruit top MinneHack competitors
- Evangelize your products or APIs
- Interact with students through judging and mentorship
- Support the development of the Midwest's tech community

We also offer additional benefits based on sponsorship commitment.
