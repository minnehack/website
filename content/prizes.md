### How do I win?

MinneHack's sponsors and organizers will evaluate each project submission and award prizes to teams based on a variety of factors. Those factors include, but are not limited to:

- [ ] Adherence to the prompt <a href="#dscl" class="clean-a"><sup>*</sup></a>
- [ ] Creativity <a href="#dscl" class="clean-a"><sup>*</sup></a>
- [ ] Coolness <a href="#dscl" class="clean-a"><sup>*</sup></a>

Check at least one of these boxes, and you're guaranteed
<a href="#dscl" class="clean-a"><sup>*</sup></a> to win!

### What if I don't win?

Smaller-scale events ("Mini Hacks") will be hosted during the hackathon [**on the Twitch stream**](https://twitch.tv/minnehack). The prizes for those events will be announced as they are awarded, but rest assured: they are equally as cool as the main prizes.
