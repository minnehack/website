# CTF

## We have a winner!
**Someone has already completed the CTF Mini-Hack and earned the top prize**. Don't worry, all hope
is not lost! If you have solved it and you would like a special **MinneHack CTF badge** in luxurious
**Grey PETG**, email acmctf at unown dot me with your physical address before the end of the
hackathon. Offer valid for the Continental US only.

Andrew, the ACM UMN Webmaster, created a super cool MinneHack CTF badge that he wants to print out
and distribute to participants. He used OpenSCAD to design the badges and wrote an equally cool
online STL viewer to let the other ACM UMN officers admire his handiwork.

Since OpenSCAD files are version controllable, **he kept track of all his work with Git**.
