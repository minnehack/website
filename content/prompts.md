Your task is to create a function or program that when given a number n, creates a "mario pyramid" of height n.

By mario pyramid, we just mean a right aligned pyramid.

If `n` is 10, then your first line should contain 9 spaces, followed by 1 hashtag. The next line should contain 8 spaces followed by 2 hashtags, and so on until you have a line of all hashtags.

Here are some examples.

`marioPyramid(1)` should output

```

`marioPyramid(2)` should output

`marioPyramid(5)` should output
