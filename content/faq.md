# Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the address of the venue?

Glad you asked! Here it is!

Coffman Memorial Union Mississippi Room and President's Room
300 Washington Ave SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, United States

### Can we win stuff?

Yes! We will ship [prizes](/prizes) directly to your home albeit **to the continental United States only**, if you are local you can also pick it up. 

Prizes are given after the event, we will contact you when you can pick them up or verify your address for shipping when we have the prizes ready.

There will be prizes for the first, second and third team aswell as for the CTF winners.

### How does topic selection work?

The topic selection process involves the MinneHack staff and MinneHack sponsors. The chosen topic will remain secret until it is announced during the keynote speech.

### How does team formation work?

There is no formal team formation process. Teams can be formed ahead of time or during the event; no formal ahead-of-time team registration is required. In the Discord server set up for the event, there will be a team formation channel to allow people who want teams or team members to find them. 

### What type of project deliverable is expected? Is the deliverable a presentation about what you built, or is is just the thing that you built?

All contestants must provide source code to the judges, which will be made publicly availble after the competition. You must also present your project to judges as they walk around the hall.

### Is there a maximum team size?

Yes: **4**. We think this is a sane limit, and also happens to be how many of each prize we are buying!

### Will the size of the team be considered (higher expectations for bigger teams)?
	
No. Furthermore, each team member receives the same prize an individual would if the team wins. Last year, the first, second, and third place competitors were all teams, so I'd advise teaming up!

### Your website says come with ideas.  Is there a general topic or theme, or is it anything?
	
There is a general topic, it will remain secret until it is announced during the keynote speech. However, it is generally helpful to come with ideas of what you might like to do. Note that only work done during the event is eligible to be judged and win prizes.

### Can I go home and sleep?
Yes, you only have to be physically there for check in, the opening presentation, and judging. See the [schedule here](/schedule).
