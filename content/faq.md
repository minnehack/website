# Frequently Asked Questions

### How does topic selection work?

The topic selection process involves the MinneHack staff and MinneHack sponsors. The chosen topic will remain secret until it is announced during the keynote speech.

### How does team formation work?
	
There is no formal team formation process. Teams can be formed ahead of time or at the event; no formal ahead-of-time team registration is required. In the Discord server set up for the event, there will be a team formation channel to allow people who want teams or team members to find them. 

### What type of project deliverable is expected? Is the deliverable a presentation about what you built, or is is just the thing that you built?
	
During primary judging the judges will walk around and score projects. The top 10 teams or individuals are then notified that they've been selected for the final judging. They produce a presentation, which is presented to the judges and all competitors.
		
### Will we be allowed to talk to judges about our project in a two-way conversation?

Both primary and final judging are both fairly interactive; primary more so due to the smaller-scale interaction.

### Will there be multiple categories for prizes?
	
Yes! They will be announced at the event.

### Is there a maximum team size?

Yes: **4**. We think this is a sane limit, and also happens to be how many of each prize we are buying!

### Will the size of the team be considered (higher expectations for bigger teams)?
	
No. Furthermore, each team member receives the same prize an individual would if the team wins. Last year, the first, second, and third place competitors were all teams, so I'd advise teaming up!

### Your website says come with ideas.  Is there a general topic or theme, or is it anything?
	
There is a general topic, it will remain secret until it is announced during the keynote speech. However, it is generally helpful to come with ideas of what you might like to do. Note that only work done during the event is eligible to be judged and win prizes.

### Is there a list of people who are looking for teammates, or any sort of built-in pairing mechanism?
	
There is not a list of people who are looking for teammates or any built in pairing mechanism. However, we will have a Discord server set up for the event with a channel specifically for people looking for teams or teammates. 

### Will you be providing travel reimbursements this year?

**Maybe!** We are in the process of figuring out what will be available this year.
